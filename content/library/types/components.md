## What are Moodle UI Components?

Moodle UI components are used to represent distinct User Interface elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others.

Many of the components used in Moodle are features of Bootstrap, and not Moodle-specific components. These are already documented in the [Bootstrap]({{< ref "/bootstrap" >}}) section of the library.

It is not necessary to document features of the Bootstrap library which are already documented.

## How do I document a Moodle UI Component?

See the 

* Copy the example component, located at `/content/moodle/component/example.md` to an appropriate file name for the component you're documenting
* Edit the front-matter at the top of the file to give an appropriate title
* Save your changes
