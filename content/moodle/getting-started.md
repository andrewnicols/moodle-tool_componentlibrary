## The Moodle UI Component library

The Moodle UI component library is the central location for documenting frequently used User Interface components used in Moodle. Moodle UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others.

This library is intended to provide documentation to anyone developing frontend features. It is targetted primarily at visual designer, front-end designers, UX developers, and anyone creating core Moodle features or Moodle plugins.

When new UI features are added to Moodle they will be documented in this library, complete with examples on their usage.
