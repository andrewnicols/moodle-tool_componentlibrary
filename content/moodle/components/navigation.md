## Primary Navigation

Moodle's primary navigation is found on every page within the navdrawer and the user menu


## Secondary navigation

Secondary navigation is found above the main content of the page, typically course pages and activity pages. The secondary navigation is context aware and changes as you navigate.

When a secondary navigation item is clicked only the content part of the page changes


## Tertiary navigation

Tertiary navigation is found within the main content page. it controls the properties of the page and when interacted with opens a modal overlaying the page instead of leaving it
